-------------------------

Requirements
---
1. GNU C Compiler or any equivalent
2. Python > 2.5

Install
---
1. Compile the modBlowfish
    - gcc blowfish.c modBlowfish.c -o modBlowfish
2. Make sistine.py executable
    - chmod +x sistine.py
3. [Optional] Put sistine.py in path
    - Make sure modBlowfish executable is present in the same dir
4. [Optional] Make a rc.d script
    - DIY

Usage
---
1. sistine.py in
    - Will connect your box to the sify network
2. sistine.py out
    - Will disconnect your internet connection

Issues
---
1. Setup your DNS entries manually
    - sudo vim /etc/resolv.conf
    - Add sify nameservers (you can get them from a online search).
    - Here are the OpenDNS nameservers:
	nameserver 208.67.222.222
	nameserver 208.67.220.220
2. Connection might fail if you're using a password with special
chars (!@#$%...) Please help debug this issue if you're a python
guy.

License
---
1. Public domain. Modify as you like.
2. I am not responsible if this script makes your box burst/fly/walk. Use
at your own risk. It works for me btw :)
